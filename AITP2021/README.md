## AITP'21 Supplementary Materials ##

This folder contains accompanying materials for the paper:

_K. Chvalovský, J. Jakubův_: Characteristic Subsets of TPTP Benchmarks, 2021.

presented at the [AITP'21 Conference](http://aitp-conference.org/2021/).

The files
[performance-features.json](https://github.com/ai4reason/public/blob/master/AITP2021/performance-features.json?raw=true) and
[enigmatic-features.json](https://github.com/ai4reason/public/blob/master/AITP2021/enigmatic-features.json?raw=true) and

contain characteristic subsets of different sizes for all TPTP problems.  These
are provided to help the developers by speeding up evaluation over TPTP.
Evaluation done on a characteristic subset (of some size) should provide better
results than the evaluation done on a random subset of problems (of the same
size).  Please consult the paper for more information.
