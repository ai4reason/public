## SMT'21 Workshop Materials ##

This folder contains accompanying materials for the paper:

_J. Jakub≈Øv, M. Janota, A. Reynolds_: Characteristic Subsets of SMT-LIB Benchmarks, 2021.

accepted for the [SMT'21 Workshop](http://smt-workshop.cs.uiowa.edu/2021/).

The file [smtlib-subsets.tar.xz](https://github.com/ai4reason/public/blob/master/SMT2021/smtlib-subsets.tar.xz) contains characteristic subsets of different size selected from all quantified SMT-LIB benchmark problems.  These are provided to help the devolepers by speeding up evaluation over SMT-LIB.  Evaluation done on a characteristic subset (of some size) should provide better results than the evaluation done on a random subset of problems (of the same size).  Please consult the paper for more information.
